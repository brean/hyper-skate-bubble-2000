# Hyper Skate Bubble 2000
Global Game Jam Game 2025

## Story
Your bubble is your lifeline, and the stakes are razor-sharp LITERALLY! You are trapped in a shiny, delicate bubble, gliding through a series of wild obstacles inside an abandoned skate park. But there’s a twist: you’re being hunted by Knifebot 2000, a relentless Roomba-like robot assassin sent from the future to pop your bubble and to end your joyride.

Dodge spinning blades, leap over ramps, and grind on rails as you race through a series of colorful, chaotic 1990s-inspired levels—arcades. Use your bubble’s momentum to pull off tricks, smash through barriers, and outrun the knife-wielding menace. Every second counts, and the faster you roll, the harder it’ll be for the evil bot to catch you.

Will you stay ahead of the blade and skate your way to freedom, or will Knifebot 2000 finally make its mark? The future depends on your moves in this 3D action packed skill game.

Hyper Skate Bubble 2000: Roll fast. Don’t pop!!
